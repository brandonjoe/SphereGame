 ### Sphere game
 Sphere game is a game that a few colleagues and I build with C# from the Unity game engine. It's a game where you move around different courses using mouse and keyboard controls. 
 
 ### Installing
 To play this game, simply download the files, and step into V3 folder. Play at "Fantastic" settings. It's important to know that running at "Fastest" won't work.
